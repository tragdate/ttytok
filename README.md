1. Start by installing necessary packages. Run the `install_req.sh` script which will install the required packages based on your package manager:

    ```bash
    
    ./install_req.sh
    ```

2. Build the Rust connector binary:

    2.1. Make sure you have cargo and rust installed:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
    ```

    2.2. Build the binary:

    ```bash
    
    make
    ```

3. Install the built binary and related scripts:

    ```bash
    
    sudo make install
    ```
